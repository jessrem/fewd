<p>The Senate is structured to give disproportionately more representation to the interests of Americans living in less populous states, such as Wyoming and Vermont, compared to residents of larger states like California and Texas. By comparing the demographic make-up of each state to the nation as a whole, we see that some groups of Americans are systematically over- or under-represented by the Senate. </p>

<div class="article">
<p>A  New York Times op-ed columnist recently argued that the Senate is "Affirmative Action for white people", on the grounds that more populous states tend to be more racially diverse, while  states with fewer residents tend to have a smaller share of people of color. Washington D.C., which is roughly half black, has no Senate representation. (One exception to the trend is Hawaii, which has fewer than 1.5 million residents and is majority Asian or Pacific Islander). The result of the U.S.'s demographic anatomy is that the Senate in 2017 over-represented white Americans by 14% and under-represented black and Hispanic Americans by 6% and 9%, respectively.<p>
